You could also change the number of sampled recall points or the required IoU overlap for a prediction to be considered a true positive, among other things. Check out the `Evaluator`'s documentation for details on all the arguments.\n",

Instead, you can only update the computation from the point that is affected onwards.\n",

    "Note that the example below uses the same evaluator object as above. Say you wanted to compute the Pascal VOC post-2010 'integrate' version of the average precisions instead of the pre-2010 version computed above. The evaluator object still has an internal copy of all the predictions, and since computing the predictions makes up the vast majority of the overall computation time and since the predictions aren't affected by changing the average precision computation mode, we skip computing the predictions again and instead only compute the steps that come after the prediction phase of the evaluation. We could even skip the matching part, since it isn't affected by changing the average precision mode either. In fact, we would only have to call `compute_average_precisions()` `compute_mean_average_precision()` again, but for the sake of illustration we'll re-do the other computations, too."
