    "#### What batch size?\n",
    "A batch size is the subset of the training dataset that is utilized in one iteration.\n",
    "It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a significant degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. \n",
    "The lack of generalization ability is due to the fact that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, batch size of 32 is a good starting point, and you should also try with 64, 128, and 256.\n",
    "Batch size below 32 might get too slow because of significantly lower computational speed as a result of not exploiting vectorization to the full extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Learning rate to use? :\n",
    "The __Learning Rate__ is the size of the steps we take to reach a (local) minimum.\n",
    "A lower learning rate means more steps and therefore trains for a longer time while higher learning rate means less steps which therefore trains for shorter time.\n",
    "Also, too low a learning rate never progresses, and too high a learning rate causes instability and never converges. In between, there is a band of “just right” learning rates that successfully train.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single learning rate that works for all optimizers.\n",
    "Learning rate can affect training time by an order of magnitude.\n",
    "Learning rate performance did not depend on model size. The same rates that performed best for 1x size performed best for 10x size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why and what optimizer to use?\n",
    "Gradient Descent is one of the most popular algorithms to perform optimization and by far the\n",
    "most common way to optimize neural networks. __Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)__ is a variant of Gradient Descent in which only a few of the samples (selected by batch_size) are used to compute gradient in every iteration. SGD can be optimized with parameter __'Momentum'__ which is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens\n",
    "oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of __SGD__ is that the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. \n",
    "If the dataset is sparse and the features have very different frequencies, it will not be necessary to update all of them to the same extent, but rather a larger update for rarely occurring features. This problem is addressed by __Adaptive Learning-Rate optimizers__ (Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop and Adam) that adapt the learning\n",
    "rate to the parameters, performing larger updates for infrequent and smaller updates for frequent\n",
    "parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main down side of the __Adaptive Learning Rate optimizers__ is that they require more computation to be performed for each parameter in each training step and more state to be retained for each parameter.\n",
    "While a simple __SGD__ Optimizer could equally be used with less computational requirements, it would require more hyperparameter tuning (__learning rate__) before it would converge as quickly.\n",

    "### What is Transfer Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is taking the weights from a previously trained network and use them as the basis for the weights in a new network.  Since there is a difference in number of categories between data sets we normally remove the top layers of the network and re-instantiate them to match the number of categories we're trying to choose between.  Using Transfer Learning will significantly speed up your training process by utilizing things like edge detection that the previous training has already learned then you can fine tune the network to your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used transfer learning base is the ImageNet data set weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is ImageNet?\n",
    "ImageNet is an image dataset organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. Each meaningful concept in WordNet, possibly described by multiple words or word phrases, is called a \"synonym set\" or \"synset\". There are more than 100,000 synsets in WordNet, majority of them are nouns (80,000+). In ImageNet, we aim to provide on average 1000 images to illustrate each synset. Images of each concept are quality-controlled and human-annotated. In its completion, we hope ImageNet will offer tens of millions of cleanly sorted images for most of the concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.\"\n",

    "To start our training we're going to utilize the Keras Fit Generator method.  This will allow us to pass in the ImageDataGenerator/flow_from_directory structure from above directly to the method.  Here is where we can also set our epochs, validation set, and callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting an epoch count can really depend on the dataset that you're using and how long you're willing to wait for the training to complete.  During out testing phase we ended up trying 100 epoch's and utilizing Callbacks to make sure that we're not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to have a **validation set** that you can try to maximize toward when doing your training.  This way you have an idea of how well things are going on a small subset of data that isn't the test set.  If you use the test set for this purpose it will be harder to tell if you're generalizing well or if you're only fitting to the test set specifically and won't do well in a real world test.  Earlier in the notebook we insantiated a validation set generator which we can pass in here by setting the generator to the validation_data paramter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to specify both the validation and training number of steps per epoch.  We can use variables defined in our generators so that we're not hard coding numbers directly in these fields.  This is done by taking our sample size and dividing by our batch size then utilizing the math.ceil function so we properly account for the final smaller batch in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we define 4 different callbacks that we're going to use during our training.  Callbacks are called after an epoch of training is complete and then will perform whatever action is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**ModelCheckpoint**: Used to save our checkpoint based on a certain set of criteria.  In this case we're monitor our loss and looking for the min value.  After an epoch it will check to see if the loss is lower than the previous epoch of training and if so then to save the model to disk.  We're also indicating that we want to save only the best model so the previous model will be overwritten.  This will minimize the amount of disk space taken up by models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorBoard**: Utilizing this checkpoint will write out the tf.events file during training so we can view them in TensorBoard.  We need to indicate a location for the logs to be saved and the update frequence for which we want the data.  In our case we're asking for batch frequence data so we need to also pass in the batch size to the function.  We can then start Tensorboard and point the --logdir parameter at the directory where the logs are saved to see how our training is going.\n",
    "\n",
    "**EarlyStopping**: This is used to make sure that we're not overtraining and overutilizing our compute.  It will monitor a metric after every epoch and see how much it has changed since the previous epoch.  If it hasn't changed significantly over the last n number of epochs it will end the training prematurely since there isn't much gain from going further.  In this case we're monitoring loss and asking for it to minimize the value, we also give a patience value of 5 which means the value has to not change significantly for 5 epochs before the training will be stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CSVLogger**: Another logging technique that can be easier to read by directly inspecting the log file.  This can be useful if you're not interested in using TensorBoard or just want to use a simpler logging output.  It will write out the metrics we're keeping track of during training and append them to the CSV file giving during the instanitation of the callback.\n",
